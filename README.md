# Recipe Picker App

The Project builds a recipe picker application that selects a recipe at random from a local data store and
displays the ingredients.

## Getting Started

Each project is run by executing the individual python scripts. It is built in Tkinter, a UI framework that comes
with Python installation.


### Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code IDE was used for this project.
A knowledge of Python is ideal as well.
